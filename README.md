# CServer
A tiny web server written in C

The purpose of this is to serve as an example of what a web server written in C needs to do. This uses HTTP, but please in any actual production application use OpenSSL or LibreSSL for HTTPS' encryption. So far it can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I plan on adding images and json as well as database interactions. If you have any questions shoot me a message.
